    <h2 id="bio">A little bit about me</h2> 
    <p>I began working while still in High School. For the period 2005 until 2007 I was completing a 
        3 Year ICHM Advanced Diploma in Hospitality Management. During this period I also worked as a chef, 
        waitress and assistant restaurant manager at a number of restaurants on an ad hoc basis. 
        In 2006 I did my industry training at Irene Country Lodge and rotated through all the operational 
        departments of the hotel.
    After completing my Diploma I was fortunate enough to be offered an international position in events 
        at the <span class="bold">Ritz Carlton</span> Naples Florida USA on an H2B visa, which expired after nine months and I had 
        to return to South Africa. While at the Ritz Carlton I learned the true meaning of customer service 
        and how this can positively influence the bottom-line. While I was at the Ritz I also spent some of 
        my free time working in the guest gift shop and restaurant as a means of gaining additional experience.
    <p>On returning to South Africa in late 2008 I freelanced as well as worked at the Sunnyside Park Hotel 
        in Johannesburg until the middle of 2009 when I became pregnant. I have successfully managed up to 
        30 staff members. I can confidently say that I understand the intricacies of how a hotel works and 
        have made communication within my department and between departments a top priority.
    When I got pregnant I decided to take a break from the working industry. But soon I got itchy feet 
        and landed a job with RoyalServe who specialize in Cleaning and Catering contracts. I was 
        responsible for completing tenders and getting them out as well as phoning clients and booking 
        meeting with our sales staff. The company split into two separate entities and put me in cleaning 
        division. A year later the company began restructuring and my position become redundant so I was 
        retrenched.
    The timing of my retrenchment and birth of my last child made finding employment complicated. I was 
        able to however secure work as an administrator for a computer company. My husband was given an 
        opportunity to start up his own PC store in another province, so I followed him to assist. Due to 
        the financial backers disappearance before the company had stabilized we had to close store.</p>
    <p>In 2015 my husband bought a 3d printer for personal use. I saw the potential and started up Fairy 
        Fountains 3d printing. My duties include but are not limited to day to day running of the business, 
        fabrication of props, sales, social media marketing, administration, basic book keeping and 
        convention management.
    With the current electricty issues we face in South Africa and with the change in the convention
        scene the earning potential of Fairy Fountains has been severally limited. Due to these reasons I
        believe it is time to upgrade my skill set and re-enter the job market as a Full Stack Developer</p>
